# Import Data and AI Assets in MLX Catalog

To import a catalog of assets first click on the three dots at the bottom of the left navigation bar and then click on `MLX Settings`. Then select `Choose Catalog` under the `Bulk Imports` sections. Find and select the [JSON file](/bootstrapper/catalog_upload.json) that describes your catalog and then your import will begin. A progress bar will appear to indicate upload progress.

If an asset exists in your Catalog, but has not been imported then make sure that all the info provided in the Catalog (API Key, Asset URL, etc.) is correct. If it is correct, ensure that the asset you are trying to import does not share a name/ID with another asset.
